# AVR_Libraries
Collection of the AVR libraries that I've written for embedded projects. This repo is under constant development so if you see an empty folder that is simply a library that I plan to support in the future.

## Directory Structure

The top level of this repo is split between device specific libraries (Devices folder) and generic libraries (Generic folder) that contain libraries that can be applied to any AVR device that supports any depedencies needed for that library.
